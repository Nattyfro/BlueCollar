I want to talk about the main bottlenecks in the construction sector. I have been working in the construction sector for 15 years in different regions.

One weakness of traditional management processes is a lack of standardization; there is no single set, single standard to follow. Most project managers are chosen based on their previous experience-and end up keeping the same procedures they used on previous projects, regardless of how applicable these methods are. There is often too much variation in a company due to this typical practice — sometimes, every department or team ends up doing their own thing and the whole organization suffers. The first step is to admit when a process is broken.
